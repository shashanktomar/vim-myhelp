# Shashank's Vim Cheatsheet

This is inspired from [technosophos](https://github.com/technosophos/vim-myhelp)

## How To Install
The cheatsheet can be used as Vim plugin. For vim-plug, add the following to your '.vimrc' or neovim's 'init.vim`
`Plug 'shashanktomar/vim-myhelp'`

After that, install the plugin by running `:PlugInstall` and then you should be able to type `:h myhelp`
